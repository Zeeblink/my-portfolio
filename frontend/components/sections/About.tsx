        <p className="mb-4">
          Hi there, I&apos;m a frontend developer with a little over a year of hands-on experience building responsive, user-first websites with React, Next.js, and Tailwind. 
          I studied Computer Science and passionate about software development and AI in general, but I fell in love with the frontend, something about bringing interfaces to life just clicks for me. 
          I enjoy clean code, great UI, and yes, I judge websites that default to light mode. 
          I&apos;m always learning, always building, and always down to learn and work with others.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          My journey in tech is driven by curiosity and a desire to solve real-world problems through innovative solutions.
        </p>
